"""Interpreter of a recipe's packing plan over a weight container (NumPy).

The plan (qwen36moe.pack_plan) says which tensor lands at which byte offset in
which chunk order; the ops here are the chunk-permutation laws phlegm verified
byte-for-byte against pools captured from OFLM's own engine (they were
open_kernels/model/pools.py's build_layer_pool / build_side / build_pack; the
frozen originals live in specs/open-engine/tests/legacy_pools.py and the test
there checks this interpreter reproduces them). src/open_qwen36/pools.cpp is
the same interpreter in C++.

The container object needs one method: `raw(name) -> bytes-like` (the
tensor's bytes as stored, in the file's raster order). It may also offer
`chunk_bytes_of(name) -> int`, the quantized chunk size that tensor is stored in
(5120 = q4_1, 8704 = q8, 4736 = Q4_K); a container that cannot say is read as q4_1.

  std_perm        standard [out, in] matmul tensor -> pool band order (64-row bands, K/128 chunks)
  q8_perm         the same tensor kept at q8: 16-row half-tiles of its chunks, in the q8 band
                  order (64-row bands, K/64 half-tiles) -- twice the bytes, no arithmetic
  expert_stripes  routed experts' up / gate as interleaved [up_k | gate_k] stripes, each transposed
  expert_down     routed experts' down slices, the RS=4 down law
  put             bytes verbatim (small weights), capped
  conv_transpose  conv1d [taps, NCH] bf16 -> [groups][taps][width]
  lmhead_q8       the q8 lm_head's 128-row supertile order
  transpose       a small [rows, cols] tensor -> [cols, rows] (qwen35's alpha / beta)

**q8 projections** (OPEN-QUANT-Q8). Where the recipe's per-role quant map says q8, the
plan carries `q8_perm` instead of `std_perm` and the pool holds the container's q8 values
as 16-row half-tiles the main cores' `gemv_q8_half` consumes. `q8_perm` refuses a source
that is not q8, naming the tensor: that is the check that a container agrees with the
kernel set it is being packed for.

**Source forms.** The three chunk ops above (std_perm, expert_stripes, expert_down)
accept a q8 tensor transparently and re-quantize it to q4_1 chunk by chunk on the
way into the pool (`requant_q4_1`), and a Q4_K tensor -- what OFLM 1.0.3+ writes --
by transcoding it (`q4k_to_q4_1`). All three forms hold the SAME 32-row x
256-column tile, so no chunk index law changes and neither the plan, the manifest
nor the kernels know the difference. That is what lets the Qwen3.6-35B fine-tunes
-- q8 attention, linear-attention and shared experts, q4_1 routed experts -- and
Qwen3.5's q8 `ssm_out_proj` run on a q4_1-only GEMV, and a 1.0.3 container run at
all (OPEN-QUANT-Q4K). Any other chunk size is refused, naming the tensor
(OPEN-PACK-PLAN).
